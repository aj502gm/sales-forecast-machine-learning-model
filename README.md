# sales-forecast-machine-learning-model

This Jupyter Notebook is part of the final project for an Econometrics II course. It was developed by Andrés de Jesús Gonzalez Melgar and Jorge Anibal Velasquez Folgar.

The objective is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to a company's operations, focusing on weekly sales, fuel price, CPI, unemployment, and temperature. The notebook includes:

    Density plots to understand variable distributions

    Outlier detection in weekly sales and unemployment

    Analysis of fuel price clusters over different time periods
